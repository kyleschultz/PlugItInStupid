on reminding users to plug in their phone if the battery will discharge completely overnight. 
Users are able to add alarms depending on which days they desire the alarm to function. 

Additionally, they can set the timezone for when they wish their alarms to function. 
The application also features different ringtones that the user can select when an alarm goes off.
